## Overview
 
### What is this website for?
 
**Babel Chat-app** Is a free to messenger app for smartphones and desktop and is available for anyone. **Babel Chat-app** uses the internet to send messages. The service is very similar to text messaging services, however, because **Babel Chat-app** uses the internet to send messages, the cost of using **Babel Chat-app** is significantly less than texting. 
**Babel Chat-app** includes the possibility of turning your messages into different languages such as Braille, Binary code, Emoji or Morse code. It also permits the users to send private messages addressed to specific users (@username), highlight several messages as important or create hashtags and be able to view all of the specifically.
 
### How does it work?
 
This website uses **Python3** as primary language and **Flask** as the framework to route viewers through the site. The site is styled with **Bootstrap**, **css3** and **Google Fonts**. The chat data is stored in a **MongoDB**.

### BUGS

To test it in different devices i started using the console toggle device toolbar, when I fixed all the versions for the different tablets and mobile screens I opened the website  from my Iphone and realised the display was not looking as it should.
To fix this I created a specific and new mobile version. For this purpose i downloaded Xcode simulator and served the website via [npm package serve](https://www.npmjs.com/package/serve) to be able to access it instantly and remotely through my own phone.


## Deployment (Heroku)

1. Create workspace in Visual Studio Code.
2. Associate it with GitHub repository.
3. Open a new app in Heroku (Europe) choose GitHub as deployment method and choose the repository of your project. This will enable yopur app to be updated with each push you make to Github if you wish.
4. The first time make sure you deploy it manually and then enable automatic deployments choosing master as the branch.
5. On your project workspace:
	```pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt```
	```sudo pip3 install gunicorn```
  - Check gunicorn is now in requirements.txt by repeating : 
  ```pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt ```
  ```touch Procfile```           
  - Open Procfile and paste:               
    web: gunicorn chat:app
  ```git push ```
  - In this case I used a Mongo DB and I was using a bashrc file to store the ```MONGODB_URI``` and ```MONGODB_NAME``` make sure to include these in the Heroku settings Config vars.

### Features Left to Implement

- Flask Login: would provide user session management for Flask. It handles the common tasks of logging in, logging out, and remembering your users’ sessions over extended periods of time.
  - Include user images for avatars.
