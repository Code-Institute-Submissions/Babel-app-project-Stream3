## Overview
 
### What is this website for?
 
** Babel Chat-app ** Is a free to messenger app for smartphones and desktop and is available for anyone interested. ** Babel Chat-app ** uses the internet to send messages. The service is very similar to text messaging services, however, because ** Babel Chat-app ** uses the internet to send messages, the cost of using ** Babel Chat-app ** is significantly less than texting. 
** Babel Chat-app ** includes the possibility of turning your messages into different languages such as Braille, Binary code, Emoji or Morse code. It also permits the users to send private messages addressed to specific users, highlight several messages as important or create hashtags.
 
### How does it work?
 
This website uses **Python3** as primary language and **Flask** as the framework to route viewers through the site. The site is styled with **Bootstrap**, **css3** and **Google Fonts**. The chat data is stored in a **MongoDB**.

### BUGS
To test it in different devices i started using the console toggle device toolbar, when I fixed all the versions for the different tablets and mobile screens I opened the website  from my Iphone and realised the display was not looking as it should.
To fix this I created a specific and new mobile version. For this purpose i downloaded Xcode simulator and served the website via [npm package serve](https://www.npmjs.com/package/serve) to be able to access it instantly and remotely through my own phone.
